## Usage

1. Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your path.

2. Build with cargo
   ```
   cargo build
   ```
3. Run the application binary
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

We recommend installing the [Slint extension on VSCODE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint).
